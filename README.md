# Gameboy_Development
This repository contains the source code for my Gameboy homebrew development project.
I use the GameBoy Development Kit (GBDK) which can be downloaded from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gbdk/files/">sourceforge</a>.

## Current Goal
The current goal is to have some basic input/output going on a DMG gameboy.

## Future Goals
- Combine a homebrew gameboy rom with an ESP8266 to do some home automation
- Use an ESP 32 in combination with a gameboy rom as a wireless controller for Visual Boy Advance
